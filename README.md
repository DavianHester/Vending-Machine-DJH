# Vending-Machine-DJH

How to execute
...........................
The user should open Git Bash and change 
into the directory of where the code is 
saved. The user will then enter two 
Commands.

./mvnw package  ---- this command will build
                     The maven application 

java -jar target/vending-machine-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

---- this command will open the application


The next step will be for the user to enter a
command to load the JSON file.

load-input ---- this command will load input.JSON

.................................
First, I wanted to show my ability to utilize
existing Tools such as Maven. I built a Maven
application within Git Bash and created Java
classes and commands to load the JSON file.

While working I focused on committing my code
to my GitHub repository often to show progress.

Unfortunately, the application to this point is
only able to load the JSON file but can not yet
interact to make any decisions.
